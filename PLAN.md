# Workout Tracker - Implementation Plan

## Overview

Building a senior-level Flutter workout tracking application that demonstrates clean architecture, professional code quality, and attention to detail. The app allows users to record workouts with multiple sets and manage their workout history.

## Design Analysis

Based on the provided screenshot:

### Layout Structure
- Single screen application with two main sections
- "Record Workout" section at top
- "Workout List" section below
- Bottom navigation bar (visual only)

### Visual Design
- Light gray background (#F5F5F5)
- White cards with subtle shadows
- Blue/Purple primary color (#5B67CA)
- Rounded corners throughout
- Clean, minimal aesthetic

### Components
1. **Set Card**
   - Exercise dropdown
   - Weight input with increment/decrement
   - Reps input with increment/decrement
   - Edit button

2. **Workout List Item**
   - Workout identifier
   - Edit and Delete buttons
   - Card-based design

3. **Action Buttons**
   - "Add Set" button (primary color)
   - Rounded rectangle style

## Architecture Decision

### Modern Architecture with Riverpod + go_router

**Why this approach:**
- Aligns with company's tech stack (Riverpod + go_router)
- Shows ability to work with existing codebases
- Modern, compile-safe state management
- Type-safe navigation
- Professional yet pragmatic

### Simplified Structure

```
lib/
├── models/          # Domain models with Freezed
├── data/            # Repository and database
├── providers/       # Riverpod providers
├── routing/         # go_router configuration
├── screens/         # UI screens
├── widgets/         # Reusable widgets
├── utils/           # Helpers and extensions
└── main.dart
```

### Key Patterns
- Riverpod for compile-safe state management
- go_router for declarative navigation
- Repository Pattern for data abstraction
- Immutable models with Freezed
- Clean, testable architecture

## Technical Approach

### State Management
- Riverpod for compile-safe, testable state management
- StateNotifierProvider for workout state
- FutureProvider for async data loading
- No BuildContext required

### Data Persistence
- SQLite for local storage
- Two tables: workouts and workout_sets
- Foreign key relationships
- Indexed for performance

### UI Implementation
- Single screen with scrollable content
- Reactive forms with validation
- Custom number input widgets
- Smooth animations

### Testing Strategy
- Golden tests to verify UI matches design
- Unit tests for business logic
- Widget tests for UI components
- Integration tests for user flows

## Package Justifications

### State Management & Navigation
- **flutter_riverpod**: Company's state management solution, compile-safe
- **riverpod_annotation**: Code generation for cleaner providers
- **go_router**: Company's navigation solution, type-safe routing

### Data & Models
- **freezed**: Immutable models with code generation
- **json_serializable**: Clean JSON serialization
- **sqflite**: Mature local database solution
- **uuid**: Unique ID generation

### UI
- **flutter_slidable**: Swipe actions for better UX

### Testing
- **mocktail**: Modern mocking framework
- **golden_toolkit**: Enhanced golden testing capabilities

### Code Quality
- **very_good_analysis**: Strict linting rules

### Why These Choices
- Matches company tech stack (Riverpod + go_router)
- Modern Flutter best practices
- Excellent developer experience
- Strong type safety throughout

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Foundation
1. Complete domain layer
2. Implement data layer with SQLite
3. Setup dependency injection

### Phase 2: Core UI
1. Build main screen layout
2. Implement workout recording section
3. Create workout list section
4. Match design exactly

### Phase 3: State Management
1. Implement WorkoutBloc
2. Connect UI to BLoC
3. Handle all user interactions

### Phase 4: Testing
1. Create golden tests first
2. Write unit tests for logic
3. Add widget tests
4. Implement integration tests

### Phase 5: Polish
1. Add animations
2. Improve error handling
3. Optimize performance
4. Final documentation

## Success Criteria

1. **Functionality**: All requirements met
2. **Code Quality**: Clean, maintainable, no comments
3. **Testing**: Comprehensive coverage
4. **UI Match**: Exactly matches provided design
5. **Performance**: Smooth, responsive experience
6. **Documentation**: Clear architecture explanation

## Risk Mitigation

- **Over-engineering**: Keep architecture appropriate for scope
- **Time management**: Focus on core features first
- **Design accuracy**: Use golden tests early
- **Code quality**: Regular linting and analysis
